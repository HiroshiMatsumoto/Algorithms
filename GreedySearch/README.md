# Greedy Algorithm

## Properties

Greedy Choice Propert

- We can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblems that arise later. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made so far, but not on future choices or all the solutions to the subproblem. It iteratively makes one greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem into a smaller one. In other words, a greedy algorithm never reconsiders its choices.

Optimal Substructure

- A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to the sub-problems.

## Example

For greedy search example, will implement building ngram tree and search.
